This policy is strongly advised. Enforce at the organisation level but be cautious of potential issues.

for example a user won't be able to set permission to allUsers or authentificatedUsers in GCS to

for watchpoints when enabling this policy (billing exports to buckets will fail, Cloud Composer needs to use beta features).

Regarding Service Accounts: Only service accounts which belong to your organization will be permitted to be included
in IAM policies. This includes:
  - Default Compute service account
  - Product specific service account (GKE, Dataproc, Dataflow)
  - Custom service accounts

This policy does not expand groups to discern members within groups. If the users are not Workspace users, they can still
be added to a gsuite group and hence be controlled via this policy (in Workspace there can be a restriction of not
adding external users to Workspace groups - in this case you may need to disable this).

Policies for this constraint can specify multi-regions such as asia and europe, regions such as us-east1 or europe-west1 as allowed or denied locations. Allowing or denying a multi-region does not imply that all included sub-locations should also be allowed or denied. For example, if the policy denies the us multi-region (which refers to multi-region resources, like some storage services), resources can still be created in the regional location us-east1. On the other hand, the in:us-locations group contains all locations within the us region, and can be used to block every region. We recommend using value groups to define your policy. You can specify value groups, collections of locations that are curated by Google to provide a simple way to define your resource locations. To use value groups in your organization policy, prefix your entries with the string in:, followed by the value group. For example, to create resources that will only be physically located within the US, set in:us-locations in the list of allowed values.
